Hi all, human and reptilians. 

Well I hate reptilians but hi anyway. I'm french. I'm here. And it's cool. I wanna create things. I guess THE CYBERPSACE IS THE BEST PLACE TO DO THIS RIGHT ? I need some water also. Ha it's raining outside. Yeahh summer in paris. Perfect. 

Lets crate guys. I'm in the mooderino. Gimme some projecterino. I want to give you my love. To the community. To the earth.
